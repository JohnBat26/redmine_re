Description:
    Generates a controller for a model ReArtifact model in the redmine_re plugin.
    Please not that the controller always generates the methods new, edit and delete for you.
    If you specify new, edit or delete as action it will be generated twice (which is not so bad).
    
    Additionally it creates a edit view (yes, we know its a controller generator),
    which incorporates the re_artifact_attributes fields.
    This way you have to write your artifact specific stuff, only.
    Since we redirect new to edit you do not need additional views for new.  

    ./script/generate redmine_re_artifact_controller <model_name> actions

Example:
    ./script/generate redmine_re_artifact_controller use_cases index show
