Description:
    Generates a model for the redmine_re plugin. The generated model acts_as_artifact
    (actually, the genreated model IS A ReArtifact with a dash of multi-table inheritance).

    ./script/generate redmine_re_artifact_model <model_class_name> properties    

    If you need to create "normal" model (, you can simply use the redmine_plugin_model generator.

    ./script/generate redmine_re_artifact_model use_case_step user:test system:text exception:text
