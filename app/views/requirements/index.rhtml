  <h2>Create a new Reqirements Artifact</h2>

  <p>
  Get started by creating a new requirements artifact. You may select from the artifacts below.<br />
  You will find the artifacts you created in the tree to your left. You can drag and drop each artifact in the tree to reorder or restructure your RE artifacts.
  The tree represents the structure of your requirements document. See <a href="#">printing</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Once you left this page you can always add a new artifact by clicking on the bar to your right. It will expand and show links to all the stuff you find below.
  </p>

  <h3><%= l(:re_goal) %></h3>
  You may want to use goals as high level requirements or to structure your requirements. There are also approaches using goals for the whole RE,
  especially for understanding the requirements (TODO links, sources, etc.) 

  
  <ul>
    <li><%= link_to l(:re_create_goal), {
          :controller => 're_goal',
          :action => 'new',
          :project_id => @project.id } %>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3><%= l(:re_task) %><br/></h3>
  If you are unfamiliar with using Lauesens Task-Based aproach for RE - it is very similiar to the famouse Use-Cases by Cockburn - 
  simply <a href="http://www.itu.dk/~slauesen/SorenReqs.html">check his website</a> or have a look
  at his <a href="http://www.itu.dk/~slauesen/Papers/RequirementsSL-07.doc">Task Template (MS Word Doc)</a>.<br />
  Most important is that you recognize the demand solution prinziple coming with the two columns of the approach.
  
  <ul>
    <li><%= link_to l(:re_create_task), {
          :controller => 're_task',
          :action => 'new',
          :project_id => @project.id } %>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Trace your requirements</h2>

  <p>
  You also may like to visualize the traces for the requirments artifacts you already created. TODO: Write even more text in here.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><%= link_to l(:re_relationship_visualization), {
          :controller => 're_artifact_relationship',
          :action => 'visualization',
          :project_id => @project.id } %>
    </li>
  </ul>
