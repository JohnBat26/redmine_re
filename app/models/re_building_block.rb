  ##### Preperation and cleanup methods #####
  

  # This method prevents that a building block is assigned to another
  # artifact_type as it was during its creation. If the building block 
  # has an artifact_type already, this cannot be changed.

      end
    end
  end
  
  # If a building block is deleted, it must be deleted from the 
  # user defined "some_attributes_representation" of the artifact 
  # selection building block. Otherwise an exception is thrown and
  # caught so that the "one_line_representation" is rendered instead.
